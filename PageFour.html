<h1>Motivations - What keeps me moving forward</h1>
<div id="Motivations">
<p3>
    Ill be honest Im not the most motivated person but there is a number of things that do keep me going.
    I try and remind myself to go through the struggle now so I can relax now. I've seen how hard its been 
    for my mother to go back to school when she was in her 30's and 40's. Trying to balance work, school, kids, 
    social life, and everything that comes with adulthood seemed impossible. Although its doable id like to take 
    a bit of a different approach. My beautiful dog Remi is a daily reminder of where I want to be in life. I strive 
    to be able to give her the best life possible. She deserves daily park trips, new toys weekly, and all the happiness
    in the world and im going to provide that.
