            With most high paying jobs there will be some for of schooling needed to be able to obtain that job. Computer science is the same deal 
            however with just a minimal amount of school you can still make a decent salary. I know for people like myself im not a huge school fan however 
            the thought of making $70k+ a year with only an AA in computer science is a huge selling point. Now think if you'd continue your schooling and graduated
            with a BA. Now you're able to qualify to apply for careers that pay $100k+ a year. Personally for me these numbers just keep drawing me and motivate me to graduate.
