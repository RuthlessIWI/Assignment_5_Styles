    <!---Visual Studio-->
    <H2>Visual Studio</H2> 
    <div id="visual studio">
        <p>Being creative has never been my strong suit. However one thing I have came to enjoy is using visual studio to turn a list of instructions into a visual representation as I engage more with visuals.
           Visual studio is a great tool to know and have as it allows you to solve simple problems with simple programs.
        </p>

    <!---Video Games-->
    <h2>Video Games</h2> 
    <div id="video games">
        <p>Ever since I could remember I enjoyed video games. I've owned an Xbox since the first generation. I think this love of games really helped kick start my love for technology and little did i know it
            was just the beginning.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Motivations-->
    <h2>Motivations</h2>
    <div id="Motivations">
        <p>
            I have lots of dreams. Graduate college, move to Florida, find a career in tech. However a heavy weight of procrastination often overcomes me. I try and remind myself of what keeps me going 
            and the motivations that keep me moving forward.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!---Programming Languages-->
    <h2>History of C#</h2>
    <div id="History of C#">
        <p>
            C# is a general purpose programming tool that has many uses in day to day life. Originally written and released in the early 2000's by Anders Hejlsberg. 
        </p>

    <!---Cyber Security-->
    <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
    <div id="Cyber Security">
        <p>Cyber security is the process that protects systems, networks, programs, devices, and data from cyber attacks. The programs reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protects against the exploitations of networks, technologies, and systems. </p>

    </div>

    <!---Pay-->
    <h2>Pay</h2>
    <div id="Pay">
        <p>
            Pay rates are some of the strongest determiners when pondering on accepting vs denying a job. Luckily with the demand being so high for IT related fields and the employee supply meeting so standards are so low
            the pay rates or pretty much everything IT related are pretty generous.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!---About me-->
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div id="About me">
        <p>
            Who am I ? Kind of hard to put that into words when asked. I suppose im a young man looking to move across the country. I've been dealt shit cards in life however my mother has taught me 
            to never give up and to always strive for greatness.
