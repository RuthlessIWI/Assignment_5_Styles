            <p7>
                It can be hard to put oneself into words. Im outgoing, social, and easy to talk to. Ive been described as a social butterfly. 
                I love doing outdoorsy type things like music festivals, dog parks, camping, beach trips, long night drives. I enjoy playing video games like GTA, Uncharted, or Call of Duty. I story game modes as I get into the stories. 
                I've lived in Washington for 21 years and although I love my home I cannot wait to leave and explore the world. Im the only boy in my family, middle child to two sisters. My mother did an amazing job of raising us on her own 
                as a single mother. When I was 12 I was working on a farm and crashed the truck I was driving which resulted in me breaking my back. 
                Im currently wheelchair bound with limited mobility in my feet, ankles, and legs. I dont let that stop me although. I own my vehicle and live my life regardless of the obsticles put in front of me. 
                You either become depressed and dwell on something you cant change or you accept the cards you've been dealt and play your hand. Thats what I've decided to do!
